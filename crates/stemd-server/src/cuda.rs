//! Fetching the CUDA runtime, for a machine that has a card but not the libraries.
//!
//! The binary delay-loads its CUDA imports and decides at startup whether they can
//! be resolved, so it runs anywhere and uses a GPU only where one is usable. This
//! is the way across for a machine with a card running on its CPU: about 1.2 GB,
//! once, from NVIDIA's own redistributable archives.
//!
//! Windows only. Elsewhere CUDA is linked the ordinary way and a missing library
//! is a process that does not start.
//!
//! Not automatic: `startup` says the runtime is missing and names the flag, and
//! the flag is the whole of the consent.
//!
//! ## The versions here
//!
//! Pinned to CUDA 13.3.1 and cuDNN 9.14.0, with digests taken from the manifests
//! NVIDIA publishes them under:
//!
//! ```text
//! developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/redist/redistrib_13.3.1.json
//! developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/redist/redistrib_9.14.0.json
//! ```
//!
//! 13.3 because that is the toolkit `mlx-sys` builds against, so the DLL names
//! here are the ones in the import table. They carry only a major version
//! (`cublasLt64_13`, `cufft64_12`, `nvrtc64_130_0`, `cudnn64_9`), which is what
//! makes a redist build usable against a binary linked elsewhere in the same major
//! series.
