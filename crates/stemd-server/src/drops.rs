//! A drop is the same job a `POST /v1/jobs` makes: hashed the same way, claimed in
//! the same store, separated by the same worker. Dropping a track a deck already
//! asked for joins that separation, and dropping the same file twice is a cache
//! hit. What differs is the two ends: the audio comes from a file rather than a
//! socket, and the stems are copied to a folder rather than served.
//!
//! Local output always includes the derived part. Over the wire it is left out
//! because a client holding the mix can rebuild it for free; a folder of stems has
//! no such context.
