 It needs an NVIDIA card and a driver new enough for CUDA 13, which means 580 or
 later. libcuda1 is listed because the binary links libcuda.so.1 and will not
 start without it. On a machine that already runs a driver it is already
 satisfied; on one with no driver at all, apt will offer to install one, and
 that is a decision worth taking deliberately. See README.Debian.

stemd for Debian
================

The CUDA dependencies come from NVIDIA's apt repository, not from Debian. Add
it before installing:

  https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/

Debian 13 (trixie) is currently a special case. NVIDIA publish cuDNN for
ubuntu2204, ubuntu2404 and debian12, but not yet for debian13, so
libcudnn9-cuda-13 cannot be satisfied there from any repository. Debian's own
nvidia-cudnn package does not help: it is 9.0.0, and it declares
nvidia-cuda-dev (<< 13~), so it is both older than the 9.5 this needs and built
for the wrong CUDA.

Until NVIDIA publish for trixie, install cuDNN 9.5 or later by hand, tell the
dynamic linker where it went, and install this package without that one
dependency:

  echo /opt/cudnn13/lib | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cudnn.conf
  sudo ldconfig
  sudo dpkg -i --force-depends stemd_*.deb

The ld.so.conf.d entry is the part that is easy to miss. Without it the package
installs, the window opens, the server reports device: gpu, and then every
separation fails on libcudnn.so.9 at run time. Everything else in Depends
resolves normally on trixie; cuDNN is the only gap.

Which distributions can install this depends on where it was built, not on
this package. A build made on Debian 13 requires glibc 2.39 and libstdc++ 14,
which Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04 have and Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 12 do not.
Everything else in Depends resolves on all four. Build on the oldest target you
mean to support.

The driver is not a dependency. CUDA 13 needs 580 or later; check with
nvidia-smi. A machine whose driver came from NVIDIA's .run installer has
libcuda.so.1 without the libcuda1 package, and apt will want to install the
package anyway. Use the distribution's driver packages, or the ones from
NVIDIA's repository, rather than the .run installer.
