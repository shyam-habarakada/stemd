stemd, bundled for a machine you cannot install packages on
===========================================================

This directory carries its own CUDA runtime, its own cuDNN, and the headers MLX
needs to compile kernels while it runs. That is why it is well over a gigabyte.
It exists for one case: a live USB, or a machine where apt is not an option.

    ./stemd

On Debian or Ubuntu, use the .deb instead. It is about 55 MB, because it takes
those same libraries from the distribution, which means one copy of cuDNN on
the machine rather than two that can disagree about which engines to load. See
scripts/package-deb.sh.

Either way the NVIDIA driver comes from the machine, not from here: it has to
match the running kernel, so a copy of one machine's driver is a version
mismatch rather than a GPU. CUDA 13 needs 580 or later.
