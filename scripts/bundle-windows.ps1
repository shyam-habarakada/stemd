# Twelve files, about 134 MB, and no CUDA in any of them. The executable
# delay-loads its CUDA imports and decides at startup whether they resolve, so
# this same directory runs on a machine with no NVIDIA anything and uses a card
# where there is a usable one. `install-cuda.cmd` beside it fetches the runtime
# for whoever wants it.
#
# That replaces staging CUDA's bin\x64 wholesale, which is where the 2.4 GB
# directory came from: half of it was libraries nothing in the program can call,
# and the rest is now a download rather than a precondition.
#
# What has to be carried is the MSVC runtime, because a machine without Visual
# Studio has no reason to have it, and libopenblas, which MLX builds as a DLL
# and cargo has no install rule for. Both are hard imports: leave either out and
# the process dies at 0xC0000135 before `main`, with no message.
